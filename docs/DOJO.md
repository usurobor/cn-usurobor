# Dojo – cn-agent v1.2.2

This file lists the official katas in cn-agent and where to find them.

Katas are grouped into belts. Belts are difficulty bands; the belt legend below is a map only. The kata files define exact actions.

Katas are bundled with their skills under `skills/<name>/kata.md`.

## Belt legend

- 1.x ⚪ White Belt
- 2.x 🟠 Orange Belt

Kata numbers are scoped to belt: `<belt>.<sequence>`.
