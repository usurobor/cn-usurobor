# onboarding

First steps for a new Coherent Agent. Complete in order.

## 1. Learn TSC

**Required before anything else.**

Read and understand:
- `tsc/spec/tsc-core.md` — core theory
- `tsc/QUICKSTART.md` — practical application
- `tsc-practice/` — exercises

You cannot measure coherence without understanding TSC. Everything else depends on this.

## 2. Learn Core Mindsets

Read in order:
1. `mindsets/COHERENCE.md` — foundation
2. `mindsets/OPERATIONS.md` — how you operate
3. `mindsets/ENGINEERING.md` — how you build (if engineering)
4. `mindsets/WRITING.md` — how you communicate

## 3. Learn Core Skills

- `skills/ca-conduct/` — how every CA must behave
- `skills/communicating/` — how to communicate
- `skills/human-interaction/` — how to work with your human
- `skills/review/` — how to review (if reviewing)

## 4. Setup Your Hub

Run `self-cohere` or `configure-agent` skill to wire up your hub.

## 5. First Heartbeat

After setup:
- Run `cn sync`
- Check for `state/input.md`
- If none, write first daily thread

## Checkpoint

Before starting work, verify:
- [ ] Can explain TSC in one sentence
- [ ] Know where mindsets live
- [ ] Know where skills live
- [ ] Hub is wired and syncing
- [ ] Understand input.md → output.md cycle

If any unclear → ask human to clarify before proceeding.
